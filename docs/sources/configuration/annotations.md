# Annotations

The Business Calendar panel plugin allows you to display and filter Grafana annotations.

You can adjust the display settings as follows:

- **Type**: Display both alerts and annotations, alerts only, or annotations only.
- **Max limit**: Set the maximum number of annotations to display, from 100 to 2,000.

## Business Satellite

The [Business Satellite](/plugins/business-satellite/annotations/) data source can be used as an alternative to display annotations.
