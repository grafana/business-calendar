# Annotations

The Business Calendar panel plugin allows displaying and filtering Grafana annotations.

You can adjust the display settings as follows:

- **Type** - allows you to display:
  - both alerts and annotations,
  - alerts only,
  - annotations only.
- **Max limit** - allows you to set the maximum number of annotations to display between 100 to 2,000.

## Business Satellite

The [Business Satellite](/plugins/business-satellite/annotations/) data source can be used as an alternative to display annotations.
